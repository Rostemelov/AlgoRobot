# AlgoRobot
a simple and fun game inspired by Algorithm City.

Basically, Functions are Queues that have the commands stored as strings.

There is a bug in the execution of the user entered code. 
Not able to control recursion of a function.
We need to be able to show each command executed individually. The code I have instead shows the end result of all the commands.
