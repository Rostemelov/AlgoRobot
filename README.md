# AlgoRobot
A simple and fun game inspired by Algorithm City.

Basically, Functions are Queues that have the commands stored as strings.

There is a bug in the execution of the user entered code. 
Not able to control recursion of a function.
We need to be able to show each command executed individually. The code I have instead shows the end result of all the commands.
 
!!NOTE!!:  While playing the game, in LEVEL 3, DO NOT TRY TO USE RECURSION AT ANY COST!!

!!! REPEATED WARNING !!!

DO NOT TRY TO USE RECURSION WHILE PLAYINGTHE GAME. THE MAKESHIFT COMPILER HAS NO PROVISION TO STOP INFINITE RECURSION.
